    "This is an extremely long section, but there are big chunks of code here, so don't be too worried.  Also, be sure to look at the original iPython code here.  This requires that you've installed [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html), but it might be helpful for you to install it anyway (make sure you install it for Python 2.7).  This helps you keep text and code together in one bundle.  It's made writing these course notes way easier!\n",

    "# The What and Why of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: Think, p. 161-182\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about objects in Python earlier. At the simplest level, objects are things that include both data and methods.  , but they are more than that. They provide a way to mimic real-world entities that have both state and behaviors.  For example:\n",
    "Bank accounts have a balance and offer ways to add, subtract and query the amount.\n",
    "Farms have an owner, size, soil moisture status, crop condition and a host of other properties, but they also grow crops\n",
    "Lakes have area, volume, pH, etc., and also grow and shrink with inputs and losses\n",
    "Each individual bank account, farm, and lake is unique, but also has much in common with other members of the class. (If not, the \"class\" doesn’t have much meaning.)\n",
    " \n",
    "OOP vocabulary distinguishes between a class, which is an abstraction (e.g., the concept of a lake), and instances, or individual objects within the class (e.g., a particular lake).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Why OOP? What are the benefits?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** - bundling and hiding. Many data objects have complex data structures, and particular methods associated with those data structures. If we didn't have \"objects\", the user would have to work through these methods each time they wanted to do some analysis.  With objects, the user only needs to know how to use the object, not what happens inside. Think of a car’s automatic transmission. It is a terribly complicated device, but the internals are encapsulated; almost anybody can use it because the interface is so simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Polymorphism** - same method name might be found in multiple classes, but have different operations appropriate for the class. We’ve seen examples of this.  The + operator means one thing for numbers but another for strings. Or, consider that the  sort() method works very differently for numbers and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance** - new classes can be based on existing classes.  You don't have to rewrite the code each time, and you can build more complex classes on simpler sets of classes.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "Python does not require OOP, but it supports OOP. As more \"serious\" programmers have taken up Python, and as it has been applied to more complex problems, object-orientation has grown with successive releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's idea of OOP is at odds with some basic principles of OOP as seen in other languages. True believers offer explanations of why the \"Pythonic way\" (see [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)) allows such things, but those explanations leave many people unconvinced. If you come to Python from another OO language you might be surprised by some aspects of OOP in Python.\n",

What this means is that the attributes and methods associated with the Parent Class become attributes of the Child Class, along with any new attributes that are declared within the child class.  As shown above it is possible to inherit from multiple parent classes.  This is not the case in many programming languages, and requires a relatively complex system of \"method resolution\".   For example, if `Parent1` and `Parent2` both contain a method `sum`, that varies between the two classes, then `ChildClassName` needs to inherit a single `sum` method.

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The class needs valid values for longitude and latitude.  It uses \"private\" variables for these named `_lon` and `_lat` respectively. All operations within the class would use these private versions. The class has a method to set values (`setLonLat`) and a method to deliver the current values (`getLonLat`) should a user wish to know them. The setter method will never assign an invalid value. (More robust code would use `try` and `except` blocks in `setLonLat` for added safety.  It would also return a value to indicate whether or not the requested `lon` and `lat` changes were successful.)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Exercise 12.7:\n",
    "Modify the example above so that the city name is also a \"private\" variable. Add setter and getter methods to access the name variable.\n",

    " \n",
    "To recap: this business of underscore variables is very common in the Python world. For example, if you do `dir([])`, you will see many variables whose name begins with `_`.  We don’t touch those variables.  There are also private *methods* we are not meant to use.  Like the `_xxx` variables, such `_yyy` methods are technically accessible.\n",
    " \n",
    "The practice of using \"Set\"-like  and \"Get\"-like methods is also very common. The next topic will cover the use of GDAL from Python. We will often see \"Get\" methods used to acquire values from GDAL objects.  This is the reason why: GDAL doesn't want us monkeying with its precious data in a non-standard way."
